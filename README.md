# 🧩 Data Validator - Java Project

A mini Java project that checks employee data for missing or invalid fields and prints a validation report.  
It simulates how a Quality Engineer performs **data accuracy and completeness checks** in automation testing.

## 🔍 Key Highlights
- Detects missing, empty, or "null" values in sample data  
- Prints a clear report with accuracy percentage  
- Demonstrates programming logic and analytical thinking  
- 100% written in **core Java** — no frameworks

## 💡 Why I Built This
I wanted to understand how QA engineers use logic to find data issues.  
This project helped me apply loops, condition checks, and reporting — just like real data validation scripts.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Save the code as `data_quality_check.java`  
2. Open terminal and compile:  
javac data_quality_check.java

arduino
Copy code
3. Then run:  
java data_quality_check

shell
Copy code

## 📊 Sample Output
---- Employee Data Validation Report ----

✅ Record 1 is valid.
⚠️ Record 2 has missing or invalid data.
⚠️ Record 3 has missing or invalid data.
⚠️ Record 4 has missing or invalid data.
⚠️ Record 5 has missing or invalid data.

Total Records: 5
Invalid Records: 4
Overall Data Accuracy: 20.00%
